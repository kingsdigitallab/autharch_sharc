      <h2>1 How do we collect information?</h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>We will obtain personal information from you when you enquire about our activities or report a problem with a
        service that we maintain through through direct contact via an e-mail or conventional mail or otherwise provide
        us with personal information. We
        may also receive information about you from third parties, for example from a friend who wants to tell you about
        our website.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>2 What information do we collect?</h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>The types of information collected might include names, e-mail address, institutional postal address, telephone
        number and your research interests. Via third-parties, for instance Google, we will have limited access to see
        IP addresses from which our website has been accessed (see Cookies, below).</p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>3 How do we use this information?</h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>We will use your personal information to provide you with the services, products or information you have
        requested and for administration purposes&nbsp;<span>(e.g. College reporting activities)</span><span>. We may need to share your information with our service providers, associated organisations and agents for these purposes.</span>
      </p>
      <p>KDL may use your personal data to resolve technical issues you encounter, to respond to your requests for
        assistance, and to repair and improve our service.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>4 How long do we retain this information for?</h2>
      <p>In the case of research projects we will retain correspondence indefinitely, as it constitutes a record of
        works undertaken and may be important for legitimate business purposes of demonstrating meeting contractual
        obligations. For further information on KCL's data retention, please see this <a
